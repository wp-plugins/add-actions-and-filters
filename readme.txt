Add PHP Code to create your own Actions and Filters

== Description ==

Add PHP Code to create your own Actions and Filters.

Provides a place to add your code that is more convenient than putting it in your theme's functions.php file.

Add your code in the administration area -> <strong>Tools</strong> -> <strong>Add Actions and Filters</strong>
but this is only available to users with Administrator role.

Why this plugin?
Existing WordPress documentation suggests adding your own functions and filters in the theme's functions.php file. This is not a good idea because

* If you upgrade your theme, this file can be overwritten and
* if you change your theme then you need to add the same code to that theme as well.

Your code additions should not have to be artificially tied to your theme. This plugin frees you from that constraint.
